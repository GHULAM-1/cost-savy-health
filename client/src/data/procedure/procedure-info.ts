 export const fullDescription = `Surgical broken finger repair, or finger fracture fixation, is a procedure used to treat fractures that cannot be properly aligned or stabilized through non-surgical methods such as splinting or casting. This surgery is typically recommended when the bone fragments are displaced, the fracture involves the joint, or the bone is broken into multiple pieces (a comminuted fracture). It may also be necessary for open fractures where the bone has pierced the skin, increasing the risk of infection and requiring immediate intervention. The goal of surgery is to realign the broken bone fragments, secure them in place, and allow the bone to heal correctly while preserving finger function and mobility.
During the procedure, which is usually performed under local or general anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision over the site of the fracture. The broken bone fragments are then realigned, or reduced, to their correct position. To keep the bones in place while they heal, the surgeon may use various fixation devices, including pins, screws, plates, or wires, depending on the complexity and location of the fracture. For simple fractures, pins are often inserted through the skin to hold the bones together. For more complex fractures, screws and metal plates may be secured internally to stabilize the bone. These fixation devices may or may not be removed later, depending on the surgeon's recommendation and the bone's healing progress.
Once the bone has been properly stabilized, the surgeon closes the incision with stitches or surgical glue, and the finger is typically immobilized in a splint or cast to protect it during the initial healing period. Recovery from surgical broken finger repair involves several weeks of immobilization, during which the bone begins to heal. Pain and swelling are common after surgery, and pain management typically includes over-the-counter pain relievers or prescription medications. Elevating the hand can help reduce swelling during the first few days after surgery.
Physical or occupational therapy is often recommended after the initial healing phase to restore motion, flexibility, and strength to the finger. This is especially important to prevent stiffness and ensure the patient regains as much function as possible. Recovery times vary depending on the severity of the fracture, but many patients experience full recovery within a few months. However, stiffness and reduced mobility can persist for longer periods.
As with any surgery, there are risks associated with broken finger repair. These include infection, bleeding, nerve damage, or issues with the fixation hardware. In some cases, the bone may not heal properly, leading to a condition known as nonunion, which may require further surgery. However, when performed correctly and followed by proper rehabilitation, surgical finger repair has a high success rate, and most patients regain nearly full function of the finger. Early intervention and adherence to post-operative care instructions are crucial for optimal recovery.`;
